my first memory of victor is bates sports camp
it was the summer of 2000
victor had the absolute roundest head i had ever seen and he and nate were in my camp squad for the first time
I was a fairly quiet boy and victor and nate were not. 
i was going to be switching schools from st. joes to webster for 6th grade and victor went there
I was gonna be friends with this dude. 
we played all the sports and i was definitely 100% better than victor at all of them and that is totally true, this is my speech and no one is allowed to doubt this.
victor is now better than me at every sport. 
i mean, look at em.
but moving on. 

but summer camp ends and the school year rolls around.
 lo and behold, victor was in mr carter homeroom, my new homerome. 
 most of victors buddies were in ms. godbout's homeroom
the two of us became fat friends. fast friends. we were stout.

victor and i bonded over being funny.
to this day victor is one of the funniest dueds i've ever met.
but what has makes him truly spectacular is not his sparkling sense of humor, oppressive optimisms, piercing blue eyes, his rippling abs, or that he keeps running incredibly long distances on maybe the most bum knee i am personally aware of.
no victor is the absolute most solid as a goddamn rock reliable dude I've ever met.
he's like a metronome. an enthusiastic metronome. my boy is amped on everything and god is it infectious. 

we used to spend high school spring break at sugarloaf, and we would just shred for an entire week. 
couldn't have done without victor prying me out of bed 2 hours after he had already eaten several breakfasts with my parents. 
he'd get me up and he'd get me psyched every single day.
then we'd drink a whole gallon of milk and crush a pack of doublestuffs in the basement. 
if you are a 13 year old boy, i highly recommend just eating the whole whole oreo package.
sophmore year of college at uvm, victor, without fail would pass out at the crack of 9pm and be up ready to go at 7.
He started ballroom dancing, and goddamn did he love it. 


he was there for everything, absolutely everything. 
my first night in jail. thankfully only night in jail.
the time I busted my knee at sugarloaf.
every single time i got all sappy about a girl. 
every time I got dumped. 
every time i wouldn't shut up about how i shouldn't have been dumped.
every time i wouldn't shut up about how i shouldn't have dumped that girl.
he was there, he was a shoulder to lean on and he was the best shoulder i could possibly hope to have.
he was there, visiting me in new york when I pulled him aside and said, hey you see that girl there, i think i'm really into her.
That was my wife ele carrying a whole pizza between bars in the lower east side on st patricks day.
Wish she could be here tonight, but cross country moves are, believe it or not, very difficult. 

Rachel, you are the first girl that victor has ever been serious about.
A few years ago he mentioned you for the first time when we were taking on the phone, and i immediately knew that this was different. 
It wasn't the normal way that you tell your buddy you're dating someone.
the way he talked about you just seemed to carry this weight, like there was a certain permanence about it that I hadn't heard before.
After meeting you, I knew this was coming because the first time i met you, you constantly heckled me. 
I donâ€™t remember what it was about, but just the tone, the *cadence* of your heckling let me know you were a perfect fit for victor, who deserves to heckled constantly.
And i hope, in the spirit of holy matrimony, he heckles you, in sickness and in health about every time you have lost a challenge and subsequently got a tattoo commemorating victor's triumph.
what a good match, you guys rule.

And so rachel, I present to you the best, funniest, sweetest, most reliable dude I know. 
Hell yeah, I'm so psyched.
mazel tov!
